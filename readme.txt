##Pump-probe and single pulse optical dynamics in 2 dimensional semiconductors based on the Hartree-Fock level Bloch equations in the electron-hole picture
##

Linear_Spectra includes analytical expressions for the linear absorption of a single semiconductor layer, in both exciton and e-h picture

pump-probe includes pump-probe dynamics on a single semiconductor layer. The pulses and the material properties can be adjusted in the parameter files. The main.py file is an exemplary use of the functions in functions.py, leading to a single pump-probe spectrum. Intraband thermalization is included via phenomenological decay of excited carriers towards a Fermi distribution. 

MQW is used to compute the dynamics and absorption in a multi-quantum well heterostructure inside a dielectric encironment. Radiative coupling and partial reflections within the substrate are included.
